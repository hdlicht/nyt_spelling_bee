# spelling_bee

This little prject tries to find all the possible game boards for the NYT spelling bee game and their scores. Obviously this depends a lot on the word list. I do not have access to the word list used by the NYT, and the the lists I've found seem to have many more words. Consequently the scores I get with this are much higher than what is possible spelling bee.
